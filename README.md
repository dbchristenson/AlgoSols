# MesiSols
MesiSols is a collection of generative pixel art NFTs on the Algorand Blockchain. Stars are not simply generated on randomization but logic as well. By using statistical distribution, star attributes were made to be balanced, cohesive, and varied. Some attributes are not shown in the actual NFT image itself but as one of the NFT's attributes. These properties are normally used to help generate the visual properties of a MesiSol.

There is NO predefined rarity given to each MesiSol. This is because the Mesiverse team wants each MesiSol to have an ambiguous value only perceived by the holder. Yellow MesiSols may be more common than Blue MesiSols but also have the chance to be attributed a binary star while Blue MesiSols do not. By eliminating rarity barriers, every MesiSol holders will not feel inferior by owning a 'common' NFT like in other projects. Information about the different attributes can be found on our website: mesiverse.org

# Introduction
The MesiSols 'App' is broken into several sections:

Generator: contains the python files for the computation and generation of a single MesiSol
Data Sets: contains some CSV files that I used to ensure that the distribution of the numbers is standardized
Image Maker: contains the python files for the generation of a single image and also for the generation of a collection of n size
Json Attributes: contains the python files for generating the metadata of each NFT so that the attributes can be displayed on
                 sites like RandGallery or NFTExplorer.

Download all the files and put them into an IDE and run the program. Using the command gen_sol() should return a star and the string
representation of one. gen_image() should save a new image to the star_pngs folder inside the Image Maker folder. and Generating a
collection should do the same on a larger scale.

Thanks for checking out MesiSols and stay tuned for more Mesiverse releases!
